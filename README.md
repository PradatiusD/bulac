BULAC-MIA 
The mission of the Brown University Latino Alumni Community of Miami (BULAC-MIA) is to provide opportunities for South Florida alumni to connect with one another as well as maintain strong bonds to the university.  BULAC-MIA does this by promoting the core goals of our overall organization: developing alumni membership and engagement, reaching out to undergraduates and prospective Brown students, as well as cultivating strong leaders within our community.

BULAC is excited about the potential Miami offers for its alumni community.  Miami is a vibrant and growing city - it is unique, bold and diverse, just like Brown.  Our growing chapter has teamed up with other organizations in the area, particularly with the Inter-Ivy Latino Alumni Council, to create  a stronger alumni base in the South Florida area.  Throughout the year, we will join other ivy alumni through social and service events.  Look for our list of monthly events on this site or through our Facebook page!

BULAC-DC
The Brown University Latino Alumni Community of DC (BULAC-DC) aims to foster stronger communication with local alumni via networking, community service, and social events. Our overall goals include maintaining a close connection to the Brown University community, serving as mentors to undergraduates, and increasing alumni engagement in the DC area.
 
The DC chapter is fortunate to be located in such an accessible and resourceful city. From politics to the arts, DC is quickly becoming a hub for young professionals who see a future in an array of fields. We strive to increase collaboration by working with all Brown groups in the area, including the Brown of DC Club and local affinity groups (IPC, A4, and TBGALA).  Throughout the year, we will partner with Brown groups and other local alumni groups to move forward our goals of service, engagement, and collaboration. Look for our list of monthly events on this site or through our Facebook page!
