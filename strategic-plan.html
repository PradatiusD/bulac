<p>The mission of BULAC, a chartered organization of the Brown Alumni Association, is to maximize the Brown experience for Latinos, to serve as a representative voice for Latino Alumni and to assist in the unification of alumni efforts to further and support the interests of Brown University. These goals shall be accomplished through networking, advocacy, and engaging (educationally and socially) Latino members of the Brown Community and others.</p>

<p>On August 11, 2012, the BULAC Board Members of the 2012-2014 term gathered during a board retreat to review and analyze the Strategic Plan set forth four years prior, in August 2008. At the retreat, BULAC President, Dania Matos, and President-Elect, Alyse Ruiz agreed to continue to pursue BULAC’s strategic plan, with common goals, to endure both their administrations.  That agreement resulted in current board members proposing and accepting three objectives to enhance BULAC’s development:  Development, Outreach and Leadership Training.</p>
<p>Development is a paramount goal because it will increase membership and alumni engagement.  As the Latino alumni population continues to grow, so should the organization that serves them. BULAC should be a vehicle for alumni to create and maintain relationships with each other and Brown University.  To complete this goal, we have successfully created regional representative roles on the board that have helped BULAC host regional events in 2012 (Miami, New York, San Diego, Los Angeles, and New York). These events resulted in new relationships and unification.  In particular, we hope to develop new regional areas for BULAC in Chicago for 2012-2013 and Texas for 2013-2016, while sustaining and strengthening our current regions aforementioned. In addition, we will use our New York region as a case study and model to assist in strengthening our development in other regions.</p>
<p>Outreach focuses on BULAC’s responsibility to the undergraduate, future Brown students and surrounding communities.  BULAC has to use alumni and their remarkable resources to assist undergraduate students who will eventually join the alumni community.</p>
<p>Leadership Training is instrumental to influencing the future of Latinos and BULAC at Brown University.  To ensure longevity BULAC must develop Latino alumni leaders to become more active in Brown activities.  BULAC will also encourage alumni leaders to participate as board members of BULAC as well as other Brown organizations (BAA, MAC, etc.), search committees, fundraising initiatives and the Corporation.  Furthermore, BULAC envisions being a repository for Latino information to assist Brown hiring at the administrative, academic and/or management level.</p>
<p>To further these objectives, from 2012 through 2016, BULAC will convene during an annual summer retreat to review each initiative, evaluate its success or failure, and develop a budget/plan for subsequent years. BULAC will then convene via conference call, at minimum, one per month, on the third Thursday of each month, at 9pm EST, with the BULAC board leadership calling in at 10:15pm EST. This Strategic Plan will serve as both a guide and initial phase in BULAC’s endeavors.  The Plan outlines potential initiatives to be employed for each objective from 2012-2016.</p>
